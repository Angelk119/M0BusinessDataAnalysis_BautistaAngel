Module 0 - Final Project

## Brief Summary

  Using Excel, I filtered the leading cause and found out the gender ratio, the total deaths, and the average death rate. After realizing the portition of deaths compared to the population of New York over this specific time, I recommend the team over at AFSP (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention) should do all the following:

  1. Branch out and improve access to suicide care
  2. Market on social media more strongly than before
  3. Reduce ways more fatalities could be caused


### Business Problem

  Although this data is from 2007-2014, it is still strong evidence that intentional self-harm is a prominent issue that feeds at us all. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) propose this problem by asking: How exactly could this mortality rate reduce for males and females alike?


### Data Lifecycle

![datalifecycle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a58f275-5daa-4538-917c-664947218548)

  Each stage of this cycle is represented by my step-by-step analysis of this data. The data collection process is completed with Excel, same goes with the processing. Once I am complete with Excel I transition into Python with Pandas for my analysis. Lastly, the presentation of the data is revealed here in the repository. 


### Excel Analysis 

  For the Excel Analysis, I filtered the data containing multiple different fatalities and decided on intentional self-harm. With this I ordered the years into a descending list and hid the mostly unnecessary columns. From here I listed the female and male deaths separately before dividing them by the total deaths getting me the gender ratio. What I learned from this was that the ratio was roughly 50:50.
