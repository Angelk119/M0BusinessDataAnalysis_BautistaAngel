Module 0 - Final Project

## Brief Summary

  Using Excel, I filtered the leading cause and found out the gender ratio, the total deaths, and the average death rate. After realizing the portition of deaths compared to the population of New York over this specific time, I recommend the team over at AFSP (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention) should do all the following:

  1. Branch out and improve access to suicide care
  2. Market on social media more strongly than before
  3. Reduce ways more fatalities could be caused


### Business Problem

  Although this data is from 2007-2014, it is still strong evidence that intentional self-harm is a prominent issue that feeds at us all. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) propose this problem by asking: How exactly could this mortality rate reduce for males and females alike?


### Data Lifecycle

</p>

  Each stage of this cycle is represented by my step-by-step analysis of this data. The data collection process is completed with Excel, same goes with the processing. Once I am complete with Excel I transition into Python with Pandas for my analysis. Lastly, the presentation of the data is revealed here in the repository. 


### Excel Analysis 

  For the Excel Analysis, I filtered the data containing multiple different fatalities and decided on intentional self-harm. With this I ordered the years into a descending list and hid the mostly unnecessary columns. From here I listed the female and male deaths separately before dividing them by the total deaths getting me the gender ratio. What I learned from this was that the ratio was roughly 50:50.

### Python Analysis

  For the Python Analysis, I opened the data onto VS Code and presented the header which showed the named columns. With that I printed the first 5 rows of the data showing 2014 data along with one from 2013. Lastly, I printed the type function to determine the data type of each element in an iterable.


### Data Types 

  The data types in this dataset are numeric and quantitative. Numeric data for the deaths, death rate, age adjusted death rate, and gender ratios. Quantitative data for the gender ratios once again as I used it for my chart.


### Conclusion 

  Next Steps: 

  1. I would've liked to compare this intentional self-harm data to something like accidents except drugs to compare
  2. Use the data ratio for more than just the deaths possibly the death rate as well
  3. Have more complex charts
