Module 0 - Final Project

## Brief Summary

  Using Excel, I filtered the leading cause and found out the gender ratio, the total deaths, and the average death rate. After realizing the portition of deaths compared to the population of New York over this specific time, I recommend the team over at AFSP (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention) should do all the following:

  1. Branch out and improve access to suicide care
  2. Market on social media more strongly than before
  3. Reduce ways more fatalities could be caused

### Business Problem

  Although this data is from 2007-2014, it is still strong evidence that intentional self-harm is a prominent issue that feeds at us all. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) propose this problem by asking: How exactly could this mortality rate reduce for males and females alike?
